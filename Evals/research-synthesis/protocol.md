# Run protocol — Research synthesis eval suite

Adapted from `Evals/onboarding/protocol.md`. Same author/grader separation rules apply.

## 1. Fix the run inputs

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Model | e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| Skill commit SHA | `git rev-parse HEAD` |
| Runner agent | Identifier of the agent/session executing `/synthesize-research` |
| Grader agent | **Separate** context — must not be the runner |
| Fixtures used | List from `Evals/research-synthesis/inputs/` |

Runner ≠ Grader. Self-graded runs are blocked at `/eval-review`.

## 2. Run the skill

For each fixture in `inputs/`:

1. Copy the fixture content into a fresh session.
2. Invoke `/synthesize-research` with the fixture as input.
3. Capture the full output verbatim — do not edit, summarize, or truncate.
4. Save to: `Evals/research-synthesis/results/transcripts/YYYY-MM-DD_<fixture>_<model>.md`

The transcript must include the full skill output plus any intermediate steps if the skill produces them.

## 3. Grade independently

The grader reads only:
- The captured transcript
- `criteria.md` for each eval
- The fixture file (to verify quote accuracy and evidence traceability)

The grader does **not** read the skill file or the runner's notes.

Grade each criterion: ✅ / ❌ / ⚠ partial. Partials are not rounded up.

For each ❌, run the introspection loop:
> "Why did the runner produce this output? What in the skill or context led to this decision?"

## 4. Aggregate across fixtures

Run all 7 evals against all 3 fixtures. Report per-fixture results and per-eval pass rate.

Pass target: ≥ 6/7 evals per fixture.

The sparse corpus fixture will likely produce a different pattern than the full-signal fixtures — that's expected and meaningful. Document the differences.

## 5. Log the run

Write `Evals/research-synthesis/results/YYYY-MM-DD_<model>.md` with:
- Header table (model, SHA, runner, grader, fixtures)
- Per-eval ✅/❌ for each fixture
- Per-eval pass rate
- Introspection findings for every ❌
- Recommended skill changes

## 6. Anti-patterns

- **Grading from memory.** Grader must work from the captured transcript only.
- **Skipping the sparse corpus.** It tests the most important failure mode (hallucinated confidence). Always run it.
- **Calling 7/7 "validated."** A single run is a baseline. Re-run on model upgrades.
- **Skipping introspection on ❌.** A failure without a "why" is half a result.
