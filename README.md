# DigitalGrowth-OS

A downloadable multi-agent operating-system template for digital growth and marketing teams. It combines marketing templates, repeatable workflows, Claude/Codex skills, and a role-adaptive configuration layer so each team member can turn a fresh clone into a useful daily work system.

**Roles supported:** Performance Marketing Manager · Content & SEO Lead · Lifecycle Marketing Manager · Website Product Owner · Analytics & Data Lead · Growth Lead

---

## Start here: first-run setup

The OS is harness-neutral. Onboarding works in **Claude Code**, **Codex CLI**, and **Gemini CLI**.

| Harness | Entry-point file | What you do |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` | Open the repo in Claude Code (CLI, desktop, or VS Code extension) |
| Codex CLI | `AGENTS.md` | Run `codex` from the repo root |

Then, in either harness:

1. Run:
   ```text
   Computer, onboard me into this OS.
   ```

2. Answer the setup interview. You will be asked your **role on the growth team** first — the rest of the interview branches based on that answer. A Performance Marketer gets different questions from a Lifecycle Marketer.

3. Review the proposed file edits before approving. The workflow shows a full summary before writing anything. Per-file confirmation is required — "sounds good" does not count.

4. After setup, start your first session:
   ```text
   /today
   ```

**Expected first-run outcome:** `CLAUDE.md` configured with your role, channels, KPIs, and agent routing. `GOALS.md` with your 30-60-90 marketing goals. `Tasks/active.md` with this week's priorities. Stakeholder stubs in `Knowledge/People/`.

## What this is

A growth marketer's daily work is high-context, multi-channel, and fast-moving. On any given day you're switching between campaign briefs, performance reviews, experiment design, email segmentation, and stakeholder updates — each needing different context, different templates, and different output formats.

A single AI assistant with one long prompt can't handle this well. It conflates channels, loses context, and produces generic output.

**This OS solves that** with a multi-agent architecture where:
- Each agent owns a specific marketing domain
- Agents coordinate through a shared file system (not direct calls)
- Each team member's configuration is set by their role at onboarding
- A Creative Reviewer gate enforces quality before any external artifact ships

For how a typical growth team week runs through the system, see `HOW-IT-WORKS.md`.

## Onboarding: role-adaptive setup

The interview **branches by role** in Phase 1B. Each role gets different questions:

| Role | What's configured |
|---|---|
| **Performance Marketing Manager** | Channels (Google/Meta/TikTok/LinkedIn), KPIs (CAC, ROAS, CPA), budget cadence, reporting rhythm |
| **Content & SEO Lead** | Content types, SEO tools, publishing cadence, organic traffic KPIs |
| **Lifecycle Marketing Manager** | Lifecycle stages owned, email platform, segmentation approach, activation/retention KPIs |
| **Website Product Owner** | CMS, CRO tools, A/B test cadence, conversion rate KPIs |
| **Analytics & Data Lead** | BI tools, attribution model, reporting consumers, team KPIs |
| **Growth Lead** | Functions overseen, OKRs, experiment prioritisation method, planning cadence |

After Phase 1B, onboarding sets:
- Primary agent (matches the user's role)
- Secondary agent (closest analytical or review partner)
- Area tags for `Tasks/active.md`
- Default templates surfaced first
- KPI placeholders in `GOALS.md`

---

## Growth team agents

7 role agents in `Agents/GrowthTeam/`. Each team member's **primary agent** is configured during onboarding.

| Agent | Domain |
|---|---|
| **Growth Lead** | Cross-channel strategy, OKR ownership, experiment prioritisation |
| **Performance Marketer** | Paid media, SEM, budget pacing, CAC/ROAS |
| **Content & SEO Strategist** | Editorial calendar, content briefs, keyword strategy, organic traffic |
| **Lifecycle Marketer** | Email/push flows, segmentation, activation, retention |
| **Website Product Owner** | CRO, A/B tests, landing pages, web analytics |
| **Analytics & Data Lead** | Attribution, dashboards, experiment reads, KPI reporting |
| **Creative Reviewer** | **Mandatory pre-publish gate** — audience fit, message clarity, CTA, tone |

Invoke any agent with: `Computer, [task]` → routes automatically. Full routing table: `Agents/GrowthTeam/README.md`.

---

## Skills (slash commands)

9 slash commands ship with the OS. Available immediately after onboarding.

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/today` | Daily brief — top 3 priorities, blockers, watch item |
| `/todo` | Add, complete, triage, or block tasks |
| `/weekly-performance-report` | Draft the weekly report across all channels |
| `/campaign-brief` | Interactive interview → fills `Templates/campaign-brief.md` |
| `/experiment-brief` | Designs an A/B test: hypothesis, sample size, read date |
| `/brief-review` | **Mandatory pre-publish gate** — checks any external artifact before it ships |
| `/channel-review` | Channel retrospective — vs. target, what worked, recommendations |
| `/email-brief` | Email campaign brief with UTMs and QA checklist |
| `/content-brief` | Content and SEO brief — keyword, intent, audience, outline |

---

## Templates

9 marketing-native templates in `Templates/`:

| Template | Use for |
|---|---|
| `campaign-brief.md` | Any paid, organic, or multi-channel campaign |
| `content-brief.md` | Blog posts, landing pages, case studies, SEO content |
| `weekly-performance-report.md` | Weekly channel metrics summary |
| `experiment-brief.md` | A/B tests across any channel or surface |
| `lifecycle-stage-doc.md` | Documenting a lifecycle stage: trigger, sequence, exit, metrics |
| `email-brief.md` | Email campaigns: segment, subject lines, UTMs, QA |
| `competitor-snapshot.md` | Paid, organic, and email competitive intelligence |
| `channel-review.md` | Post-period channel retrospective |
| `decision.md` | Channel decisions: options, reasoning, reversal conditions |

---

## Quality gate

Every external artifact — ad, email, landing page, content piece, campaign brief — must pass `/brief-review` before shipping. The Creative Reviewer agent checks:
- Audience fit
- Message clarity (3-second test)
- CTA strength
- Tone match for channel and lifecycle stage

Verdict: **Pass** / **Pass with changes** / **Revise and resubmit**. No exceptions.

## Privacy and GitHub

Before pushing a personalised copy:
- Remove or anonymise: stakeholder names, company strategy, budget figures, customer data
- The `.gitignore` includes commented-out entries for `CLAUDE.md`, `GOALS.md`, `Tasks/`, `Knowledge/People/`, and `Projects/` — uncomment these if you've filled in real personal context and want to share only the template shell

This repo is safe to push as-is while placeholders are still in place.

---

## Operating contract

Four default principles, configurable during onboarding:

1. **Channel-first thinking.** Every recommendation ties back to a specific channel, audience, or metric.
2. **Artifact quality.** Briefs and reports are designed for the intended reader.
3. **Test before scale.** Hypotheses run as experiments before budget commits.
4. **Numbers over narrative.** Name the metric, the target, and the delta.
